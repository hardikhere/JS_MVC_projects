# JS_MVC_projects
Project I have created to practise Vanillajs and **MVC** architecture, :smile: 
you can use it to learn but you can not use it to teach on youtube etc. Projects are Desktop Responsive only, Goal is to learn JS and MVC not responsive design. Still you will find a lot of Flexbox in it to learn. :muscle:
